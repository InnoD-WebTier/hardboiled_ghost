Do they experience something incredibly more difficult than other foreign musicians? Probably. But I think it's largely because they need to improve their English... beyond the basics.

Regulation will not occur retroactively, however. But be warned that from this moment onward, we will be following through with these regulations for our blog.\n\n2) **In regards to my post.... **From the beginning, the intention of the entry was never to attack an individual for _being_ a racist, but rather to note one of the many things that spurred me to feel disgusted towards acts of racism, hate speech, and hate crime. I took great care to conceal the identity of the owner of the album, because I felt it would take away from the purpose of the post. My point was not to direct attacks towards a person, but rather, to promote thought on hate speech and hate crime that continue today, despite a belief that our society has advanced and is no longer racist.\n\nIt is worthy to note that this post was published a while ago: after the post was written, I took the initiative to talk with the person whose Facebook photo album I noted. The person themself noted that the photo album could be construed as racist, and agreed to take them down. The act, to me, was their acknowledgment that the photos were harmful and inappropriate.\n\nRacism appears in all sorts of forms and too frequently. However, I firmly believe in redemptive actions and that racist actions cannot be considered within a vacuum. Education should be the first steps we as a community should take in response to racism, instead of jumping towards condemnation and punishment. That may sound idealistic and naive, but it is a belief that I hold strongly. It is important that we as a community continue to strive to educate others as well as ourselves so that we can truly tolerate one another and create the cohesive APA community that for so long has been so divisive.\n\nHowever, it is also bad for us to let actions like this to continue. If education does not work, then the next step is to take more serious actions. Ignoring racism when it occurs is just as detrimental as being racist. I'm still admittedly naive and inexperienced, but I hope that these words are taken with weight\n\n3) Although I'm pleased that the hardboiled blog has been getting more hits and has been receiving a lot more attention, I am largely disappointed with the reasons for this jump in activity. As many in the comments have cited, the post was condemning all forms of hatred, especially senseless hatred. Although racism is always terrible, fighting racism with further hateful speech perpetuates the problems and does not create meaningful solutions. So I, again, would like everyone to refer to the community rules that this blog will now be regulated by in order to prevent this sort of recklessness in the future\n\nFinally, I encourage anyone to contact me at [my email address,](elaineschen@gmail.com) in the chance that people feel personally offended by the things I said and would like to shoot some angry comments directed specifically at me. I do not regret the things I wrote, though I do regret the actions and hurt feelings that occurred around them.\n\nNOW, with all that being said, I hope people continue to visit this blog for future updates.

It's a pretty bold move for Eastwood to lend his star power to shed light on  Hmong gang violence. But aside from the A for effort, the movie was pretty much a bust in my opinion. Would it really kill Hollywood to tell a story where a Hmong person was the one to resolve the conflict? Instead we get a snarling, macho, white guy (Walt Kowalski/Eastwood) who saves the Hmong women and children from their own kind. Likewise, it irked me that a huge part of the plot was about Eastwood teaching Thao, the teenage Hmong boy, what it means to be a man. According to the movie, a real man drowns his conversations in a stream of curses, totes a big gun, and works in construction. I know that Eastwood is supposed to play a very grumpy and abrasive character but it's so overdone. Likewise, the interactions between Walt and Thao/his sister Sue (played by Bee Vang and Ahney Her) were awkward and unnatural. Even after they become friends and Walt comes over to have a barbecue at their house, he continues to call them gooks and somehow it's supposed to be endearing... yeah, that doesn't usually do it for me.

To that I say, \"To hell with the subtleties, if you're going to be cliche and racist than why not go all out?\" (read with immense sarcasm).\n\nThe basic plot synopsis: Kreuk's character seeks revenge after daddy is kidnapped, trains to be kung-fu warrior (by a white guy with black hair extensions?!), and kicks butt while looking pretty for the camera. Watching the trailer definitely reminded me of that awful show that premiered last year, \"Samurai Girl.\" Hey mainstream media, if you're going to be racist can you at least get a little more creative?

To that I say, \"To hell with the subtleties, if you're going to be cliche and racist than why not go all out?\" (read with immense sarcasm).\n\nThe basic plot synopsis: Kreuk's character seeks revenge after daddy is kidnapped, trains to be kung-fu warrior (by a white guy with black hair extensions?!), and kicks butt while looking pretty for the camera. Watching the trailer definitely reminded me of that awful show that premiered last year, \"Samurai Girl.\" Hey mainstream media, if you're going to be racist can you at least get a little more creative? Yeah, thanks.\n\n(Thanks Monty!)","image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1003,"created_at":1233911975000,"created_by":1003,"updated_at":1233911975000,"updated_by":1003,"published_at":1233911975000,"published_by":1003},{"id":239,"title":"Not APA news, really...","slug":"Not-APA-news-really","markdown":"But hilarious, nonetheless.

Still largely uncovered by campus press, here’s an open letter from students of NYU’s Asian/Pacific/American (A/P/A) department to the department’s administration protesting a (currently shelved, but still very plausible) proposal to remove the A/P/A major/minor programs and restructure them as concentrations instead: \n\n----\n\nApril 26, 2009\n\nDear Faculty and Staff of the A/P/A Studies Department:\n\nAs students deeply concerned with the future of Asian/Pacific/American (A/P/A) Studies, as well as other academic programs within the Social &#038; Cultural Analysis (SCA) Department, we would like to address the tentative dismantling of the A/P/A major and minor program into a concentration.\n\nFirst, we are disappointed by the hasty and exclusive manner in which information was shared with the students who would be affected by this major decision. Potential students who would have spoken on behalf of this concern were unable to exercise agency due to logistical constraints. One week ago, Professor Lok Siu informed a select group of students interested in A/P/A Studies about a meeting on Friday, April 24, to discuss the “future of A/P/A Studies.” Unfortunately, it was not until the night before the meeting that three students discovered that the topic of discussion was in fact regarding the tentative dismantling of the A/P/A major and minor program. The short time-span between the point of discovery and the time of the meeting made it difficult to contact and disseminate this information to other concerned classmates. As students who are a part of SCA, we are asking:\n\n\tWhy was the informational meeting limited to only some A/P/A Studies students from Prof. Siu's class Friday afternoon?\n\n\tWhy wasn't there a town hall meeting for all SCA students?\n\nSCA taught us the necessity of critical analysis- challenging the status quo as opposed to passively abiding by the given set of rules and explanations of “The Man.” Therefore, as critical students, we feel the obligation to question and challenge the inherent power structures, which everyone occasionally falls victim to. SCA is a unique department that prides itself in its deep historical inquiries and applied knowledge regarding modern developments. While we do acknowledge and esteem the transdisciplinary nature of SCA, we also believe it is crucial to provide an opportunity to focus on a specific discipline involved in the intersectional links we study. Without the option for a narrower focus, we believe it would be difficult to adequately study and address the issues relevant to these intersectional relations.\n\nSecond, at this meeting on Friday, a group of nine students learned that the “SCA” administration was considering the so-called alteration of not only the A/P/A major and program, but the other SCA programs as well. It was revealed that due to management issues, budgetary concerns and lack of student interest, “SCA” was therefore converting the A/P/A major and minor into a concentration. Students were assured that this action would not “shrink” the program and the number of course offerings.\n\nHowever, we find it difficult to believe that the A/P/A studies program would not eventually be downsized for the following reasons:\n\n\tThere are currently only four full-time faculty that teach in the A/P/A Studies Department, one of only whom is not teaching in any other department at NYU. If the current major and minor are eliminated, we are concerned that the A/P/A Studies would lose legitimacy as a program, making it difficult to hire new, permanent full-time faculty.\n\n\tFurther consolidating all ethnic studies programs into one massive concentration could cause a scramble for already scarce resources among the SCA disciplines, rather than foster cooperation.\n\n\tIf we allow A/P/A and other programs to be lumped into one massive category, we would be agreeing that all these minority groups are the same and don’t need any specialized focus, but we know that, while our histories do overlap and intersect, we also have different stories. At a time when ethnic studies are undervalued on college campuses and by the general public, ethnic studies programs are even more prone to being marginalized in the hierarchies of university academia.\n\nThird, ** NYU always prides itself in being located in one of the most culturally diverse cities in the world. However, by attempting to diminish the importance of ethnic studies and lumping the programs into one huge category, NYU would be reinforcing the same Eurocentric curriculum that our SCA classes have been teaching us to challenge all along. ** In doing so, the administration would be implying that the history and struggles of A/P/As, as well as other marginalized groups, are not important enough to be considered a real major. As students, we acknowledge the danger of a so-called post-racial society in an era which has seen the election of the United States' first Black president. In light of the general fear of addressing race in this country (under the assumption that racism doesn't exist anymore), we need specific ethnic studies classes as a safe haven to engage in that dialogue. **New York City is a “crucible” for SCA’s work, “both in its community orientation and its connections to global networks,” according to principles of the department. It would be hypocritical of NYU to flaunt its multi-ethnic demographics while neglecting to tend to the needs of these populations.\n\n**\n\nWe believe there is indeed a huge interest in establishing a space for dialogue specific to A/P/A history and issues. Just recently, on April 18, the 3rd annual NYC Asian American Student Conference (NYCAASC) brought together 350 students from around the NYC area onto NYU's campus to discuss and learn about issues pertinent to the A/P/A community. Students at the City University of Hunter College, for example, have been fighting hard to establish A/P/A Studies at their own school, similar to the ones at institutions such as NYU and Columbia University. **While the issues and knowledge of the history of A/P/As are widely overlooked in allof the United States, the East Coast, in contrast to the West, must address its relatively younger generation of Asian-Pacific Americans.**\n\nWe do not want to spend two pages stating the obvious problems with the elimination of our major and other majors in SCA. Instead, we want to focus our energy on strategies to strengthen the programs that are already established. The following suggestions and comments are based on the limited amount of information that we have as of this moment:\n\n\tAs students, we are committed to uphold the values that SCA &#038; A/P/A promote. **We see a strong need to distinguish East Asian Studies and A/P/A Studies.**\n\n\tThe A/P/A program needs more visibility on our campus. We believe that it is not a lack of student interest, but rather a lack of exposure to information. We should focus on a campaign to expose NYU students to the unique offerings of these different programs in SCA. One way is to advertise substantially during Welcome Week. Another way is to list A/P/A Studies as one of the majors that NYU offers, when brochures are sent to prospective students.\n\n\tIn order to truly progress, we need to address present issues that are taking place. This can only happen if there are more course offerings and more professors. Following the 2008 Presidential Campaign, Professor Dent offered a course entitled, \"Deconstructing Obama.\" Likewise, the A/P/A Department should also provide course offerings responsive to student needs.\n\n\tIt is important to **empower SCA students with knowledge and transparency.** For instance, none of the nine students on Friday knew about the A/P/A program budget for student development. **If students were involved from the very beginning, they would have been more likely to utilize those funds to help our program flourish.**\n\nOverall, we feel very strongly about the A/P/A program, and the last thing we want to see is its deterioration. We want to help it progress and grow stronger. By allowing our program to disintegrate, we would be going against the founding principles of the A/P/A Institute. We would like to thank you for your time and hope that we can work together to think of more ways to address this dire issue.

","html":"<p>\tAs evidenced by the date of the letter below, this is hella old news, and I deeply apologize for my tardiness on this exceedingly important issue. Still largely uncovered by campus press, here’s an open letter from students of NYU’s Asian/Pacific/American (A/P/A) department to the department’s administration protesting a (currently shelved, but still very plausible) proposal to remove the A/P/A major/minor programs and restructure them as concentrations instead: </p>\n<p>----</p>\n<p>April 26, 2009</p>\n<p>Dear Faculty and Staff of the A/P/A Studies Department:</p>\n<p>As students deeply concerned with the future of Asian/Pacific/American (A/P/A) Studies, as well as other academic programs within the Social &#038; Cultural Analysis (SCA) Department, we would like to address the tentative dismantling of the A/P/A major and minor program into a concentration.</p>\n<p>First, we are disappointed by the hasty and exclusive manner in which information was shared with the students who would be affected by this major decision. Potential students who would have spoken on behalf of this concern were unable to exercise agency due to logistical constraints. One week ago, Professor Lok Siu informed a select group of students interested in A/P/A Studies about a meeting on Friday, April 24, to discuss the “future of A/P/A Studies.” Unfortunately, it was not until the night before the meeting that three students discovered that the topic of discussion was in fact regarding the tentative dismantling of the A/P/A major and minor program. The short time-span between the point of discovery and the time of the meeting made it difficult to contact and disseminate this information to other concerned classmates. As students who are a part of SCA, we are asking:</p>\n<p>\tWhy was the informational meeting limited to only some A/P/A Studies students from Prof. Siu's class Friday afternoon?</p>\n<p>\tWhy wasn't there a town hall meeting for all SCA students?</p>\n<p>SCA taught us the necessity of critical analysis- challenging the status quo as opposed to passively abiding by the given set of rules and explanations of “The Man.” Therefore, as critical students, we feel the obligation to question and challenge the inherent power structures, which everyone occasionally falls victim to. SCA is a unique department that prides itself in its deep historical inquiries and applied knowledge regarding modern developments. While we do acknowledge and esteem the transdisciplinary nature of SCA, we also believe it is crucial to provide an opportunity to focus on a specific discipline involved in the intersectional links we study. Without the option for a narrower focus, we believe it would be difficult to adequately study and address the issues relevant to these intersectional relations.</p>\n<p>Second, at this meeting on Friday, a group of nine students learned that the “SCA” administration was considering the so-called alteration of not only the A/P/A major and program, but the other SCA programs as well. It was revealed that due to management issues, budgetary concerns and lack of student interest, “SCA” was therefore converting the A/P/A major and minor into a concentration. Students were assured that this action would not “shrink” the program and the number of course offerings.</p>\n<p>However, we find it difficult to believe that the A/P/A studies program would not eventually be downsized for the following reasons:</p>\n<p>\tThere are currently only four full-time faculty that teach in the A/P/A Studies Department, one of only whom is not teaching in any other department at NYU. If the current major and minor are eliminated, we are concerned that the A/P/A Studies would lose legitimacy as a program, making it difficult to hire new, permanent full-time faculty.<br />\n\tFurther consolidating all ethnic studies programs into one massive concentration could cause a scramble for already scarce resources among the SCA disciplines, rather than foster cooperation.<br />\n\tIf we allow A/P/A and other programs to be lumped into one massive category, we would be agreeing that all these minority groups are the same and don’t need any specialized focus, but we know that, while our histories do overlap and intersect, we also have different stories. At a time when ethnic studies are undervalued on college campuses and by the general public, ethnic studies programs are even more prone to being marginalized in the hierarchies of university academia.</p>\n<p>Third, <strong> NYU always prides itself in being located in one of the most culturally diverse cities in the world. However, by attempting to diminish the importance of ethnic studies and lumping the programs into one huge category, NYU would be reinforcing the same Eurocentric curriculum that our SCA classes have been teaching us to challenge all along. </strong> In doing so, the administration would be implying that the history and struggles of A/P/As, as well as other marginalized groups, are not important enough to be considered a real major. As students, we acknowledge the danger of a so-called post-racial society in an era which has seen the election of the United States' first Black president. In light of the general fear of addressing race in this country (under the assumption that racism doesn't exist anymore), we need specific ethnic studies classes as a safe haven to engage in that dialogue. <strong>New York City is a “crucible” for SCA’s work, “both in its community orientation and its connections to global networks,” according to principles of the department.

In the column, she mentions how she wanted to be noticed by her caucasian peers as an equal (i.e. by having parents play in country clubs and eat deviled egg sandwiches) but at the end, has a realization that deep down inside, she is \"Azn\", that she too likes Sanrio products and big bubbly writing.\n\nHonesty, she shouldn't be embarrassed by girls who enjoy Asian paraphernalia; we should be embarrassed by people like her who draw on superficial features as salient measures of identity. I see no real difference in her article and the numerous video postings on Youtube on \"how to be a fob\".\n\n**Monte's take**: Wow, an azn hater. I didn't even realize the concept of being \"azn\" had escaped middle school but wow, here it is. Are you kidding me? This girl isn't embarassed of her own race? Nobody who respects her own culture would spend 2/3 of an article spewing hate on it, and then spend the last 1/3 reconciling with it. First off, being \"azn\" shouldn't be classified as emoticon loving, peace sign waving, hello-kitty loving people. If that's being \"azn,\" a subgroup of \"asian,\" then I know too many confused white people. Emotions, hello-kitty, and peace signs are all pretty popular cultural norms that deserve respect in their own right, not hate. I personally don't care for hello-kitty, but I certainly do not judge others for doing so. I don't understand where this concept came that the aforementioned traits are \"embarrassing.\" I think what's embarrassing is being on a newspaper staff belonging to the most prestigious public university in the world and having the audacity to publish an article that reinforces stereotypes. This article tries to redeem itself at the end saying it embraces \"azn,\" but it really doesn't. It just reconciles it. There is no celebration of culture, and what's especially sad is that there's so much more to Asian American culture that is never mentioned );\n**\nCecilia's Take**: **what.the.hell**. I think a part of my soul just shriveled up and died after reading this. First off, Daily Cal, when did self-deprecation, cultural ignorance, and general ludicrousness become news? Pang begins by saying it's ridiculous for her to hide her oh-so-embarrassing Asian-ness because of her \"squinting eyes\" and ethnic last name, as if she's tainted and marked as inferior. Internalized racism much? More than being angry at her, I'm incredibly disturbed by the fact that she just doesn't get it. Even when she embraces her \"azn\" side, she still speaks about Asian identification as a disorder or illness that cannot be suppressed in spite of desires to absorb mainstream American norms to remedy her internal handicap. What really gets me though is a certain retort that follows someone's comment that the writer should take an Asian Am class: \"Don't you know the saying \"When in Rome, do as the Romans?\" Being azn is cute.. IN ASIA. Being an American-born azn IS NOT. How is flashing the peace sign in photos a part of Asian culture? Um, what? And what in the WORLD does Asian American studies have to do with anything? How would Asian AMERICAN studies help??\" Um I don't know, generate some sort of intellectual thought on racism and identity? Thank God for alternative media is all I can say.\n\n**Denise’s Take: **Playing on Cecilia’s aformentioned “disease” metaphor, I really feel that this author’s discomfort with her identity is the result of a misdiagnosis. “Asianness/Aznness” is not a virulent disease-like state that can only be “lived with”; however, idiocy and ignorance are. But I’ll refrain from being as mean as I’d like to be; while Pang’s uninformed, judgmental generalizations of “Azns” and her self-deprecating fear of being judged are indubitably HILARIOUS, they are also tremendously tragic. The quality of this piece’s writing as well as the mention of a “dorm room” at the end of the article already suggest the author’s youth, and it may be possible that she comes from somewhere where poorly-crafted, racist vitriol is tolerated or even considered funny. No biggie. Humans make mistakes to learn, and it may just be incredibly unfortunate that this one was racist, horrid, and made many people feel very, very sad for society (especially that rather distasteful remark about the Wah Ching Gang. Classy!).\n\nThe real culprit is whatever idiot at The Daily Cal who thought this was appropriate to publish. This was essentially the only piece in this issue that did not have to deal with the walkout–really? Of everything in the world to have an opinion about aside from the walkout, the only one worth publishing was this sophomorically written regurgitation of antiquated stereotypes. This is absolutely pathetic that The Daily Cal thought this passes off for news, or even intellectual thought worth representing at this university. Maybe this was an attempt to join the illustrious ranks of such schools as [Yale](http://hardboiled.berkeley.edu/issues/126/126-5-tune.html) and [Dartmouth](http://hardboiled.berkeley.edu/issues/125/125-3-dartmouth.html) in terms of unfunny, anti-Asian “satire”  (disclaimer: I realize that the vast majority of students at Yale and Dartmouth are probably far more intelligent than the perpetrators of those two articles). In any case, it’s a particular slap in the face,considering the complete lack of discussion on how the budget cuts will affect API students outside of API spaces. Nah, don’t worry, our progressive spaces, representation from underserved API demographics, and classes that speak to our communities’ interests aren’t in danger at all. The biggest problems we have today are making sure we don’t look like “wannabe geishas” or choosing between the “ordinary square eraser, or handy and efficient but Azn clicking eraser.”\n\nOn a lighter note, I found this online comment on the article pretty fucking funny:\n\n“One last thing.. Democrats make fun of Republicans all the time, stereotyping them as gun-toting, Bible-thumping conservatives.\n\nDo white Democrats then have “classic internalized racism” for their own race as well??”\n\n….LOL.","html":"<strong>Tawny's Take</strong>: There are many things in the world that are embrace-able: teddy bears, pillows...But on the less tangible side, activism and personal realization can also be embraced.\nToday in the Daily Cal, sandwiched next to articles covering yesterday's <a href=\"http://www.ucstudentwalkout.com/\">walkout </a> was a column titled <a href=\"http://www.dailycal.org/article/106788/embrace_your_inner_azn\"> \"Embrace Your Inner Azn (sic)\" </a> Basically the writer, Eden Pang, writes about how \"embarrassing\" it is to be identified as \"Azn\", as if there are a number of negative connotations behind liking Hello Kitty or posing for pictures with peace signs.

By now, many of you have probably heard about the tragic shooting at the military base in Fort Hood, Texas. If you haven't heard, what happened was that Major Nidal Malik Hasan went on a shooting spree that killed and injured many coworkers at the base where he worked. Reports say that he was upset over being deployed to the Middle East because he was terrified over the prospect of coming back with PTSD like the soldiers he had been counseling. (Hasan worked as a psychiatrist). Further, he had been doubting his career choice after other soldiers began harassing him about being Muslim.\n\nWhere's my sore spot in all of this? A very stupid New York Times article felt the need to include in their coverage an extra little tidbit:\n\n_In one posting on the Web site Scribd, a man named Nidal Hasan compared the heroism of a soldier who throws himself on a grenade to protect fellow soldiers to suicide bombers who sacrifice themselves to protect Muslims.\n\n“If one suicide bomber can kill 100 enemy soldiers because they were caught off guard that would be considered a strategic victory,” the man wrote. It could not be confirmed, however, that the writer was Major Hasan._\n\nI repeat: it could not be confirmed. Isn't that what you call... a rumor? And wouldn't reporting a rumor therefore be, I don't know... irresponsible, sensationalist, wrong? **hardboiled **gets a lot of crap for having strong opinions and edge but this is precisely why we do it folks. We're not trying to fill your dose of news with subtle brainwashing that reads: this unstable man is a terrorist. I'd pick my blatantly biased and honest **hardboiled **any day.\n\nMy heart goes out to the families of all the victims of this shooting and I think what happened is a very screwed up incident of unnecessary violence. What this man did was god awful. Yet from a journalist's standpoint I cannot believe how poorly the situation has been covered. It's not hard to imagine what it would be like if the shooter had not been Middle Eastern or Muslim. The emphasis on his psychological instability would be crucial... would anyone think he was a terrorist?\n\nOh and by the way, the NYT has recently written a follow up article entitled [\"Little evidence terror plot based in killing.\" ](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/08/us/08investigate.html)","html":"No, not the Daily Cal (I said news-- OH SNAP!)... this time I mean mainstream, mainstream.

A very stupid New York Times article felt the need to include in their coverage an extra little tidbit:\n\n<em>In one posting on the Web site Scribd, a man named Nidal Hasan compared the heroism of a soldier who throws himself on a grenade to protect fellow soldiers to suicide bombers who sacrifice themselves to protect Muslims.\n\n“If one suicide bomber can kill 100 enemy soldiers because they were caught off guard that would be considered a strategic victory,” the man wrote. It could not be confirmed, however, that the writer was Major Hasan.</em>\n\nI repeat: it could not be confirmed. Isn't that what you call... a rumor? And wouldn't reporting a rumor therefore be, I don't know... irresponsible, sensationalist, wrong? <strong>hardboiled </strong>gets a lot of crap for having strong opinions and edge but this is precisely why we do it folks. We're not trying to fill your dose of news with subtle brainwashing that reads: this unstable man is a terrorist. I'd pick my blatantly biased and honest <strong>hardboiled </strong>any day.\n\nMy heart goes out to the families of all the victims of this shooting and I think what happened is a very screwed up incident of unnecessary violence. What this man did was god awful. Yet from a journalist's standpoint I cannot believe how poorly the situation has been covered. It's not hard to imagine what it would be like if the shooter had not been Middle Eastern or Muslim. The emphasis on his psychological instability would be crucial... would anyone think he was a terrorist?\n\nOh and by the way, the NYT has recently written a follow up article entitled <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/08/us/08investigate.html\">\"Little evidence terror plot based in killing.\" </a>","image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1003,"created_at":1257870304000,"created_by":1003,"updated_at":1257870304000,"updated_by":1003,"published_at":1257870304000,"published_by":1003},{"id":508,"title":"Police brutality & hypocrisy are not acceptable.","slug":"Police-brutality-and-hypocrisy-are-not-acceptable","markdown":"Everything is a mess.

Nonetheless, I saw [this story about Chinese tenant evictions in San Francisco's North Beach neighborhood on Angry Asian Man](http://cbs5.com/local/north.beach.evictions.2.1427811.html), and absolutely HAD to comment on it.\r\n\nIt's concomitantly amusing and infuriating how blatantly racist this MacDonald noob is; I'm starting to believe it's actually a bit refreshing how he, unlike others who deny their efforts are racist, is actually coming out and admitting he's a big fat racist. Some gems from the article:\r\n\n1) \"MacDonald said he doesn't think anybody will end up on the street, because he believes the renters' families will help.\r\n\n'That's why we have families. If these people are as old as you say they are, then they have 2, 3 generations younger than them. I meet these people - you went to school with these people - they're brain surgeons. Okay? These are Asian Americans. they're smart, hard-working industrial people, addicted to the acquisition of real estate,' MacDonald said.\r\n\nWhen CBS 5 pointed out that MacDonald appeared to have generalized, painted with a broad brush, he said, 'I have. I'm just a private person, not a politician.'\"\r\n\nNo, Mr. MacDonald, you're not a politician. But that doesn't mean you're not a public figure, making a public case against these tenants, and giving an interview that may largely sway public opinion because you're the primary attorney working on this case and thus we trust you. And thus the fact that you're not a politician justifies the fact that you're backing up your case with egregious generalizations based on the tenants' race. Props, though, for owning up the bigoted flaws in your argument. |\\/|0|)31 |\\/|||\\|0R|7|35 F7W!!!!!1one\r\n\nAlso, what's with characterizing Asians as smart, hardworking, and \"addicted to the acquisition of real estate\"?? This to me is highly reminiscent of the whole Yellow Peril, the Chinaman is conspiring to take our California, pre-Chinese Exclusion crap, but maybe I'm just imagining things (maybe?).\r\n\n2) \"'There are only about three counties out of 60-something in California that give anything more than a 30-day notice,' said MacDonald.

Nonetheless, I saw <a href=\"http://cbs5.com/local/north.beach.evictions.2.1427811.html\">this story about Chinese tenant evictions in San Francisco's North Beach neighborhood on Angry Asian Man</a>, and absolutely HAD to comment on it.\r\n\r\nIt's concomitantly amusing and infuriating how blatantly racist this MacDonald noob is; I'm starting to believe it's actually a bit refreshing how he, unlike others who deny their efforts are racist, is actually coming out and admitting he's a big fat racist. Some gems from the article:\r\n\r\n1) \"MacDonald said he doesn't think anybody will end up on the street, because he believes the renters' families will help.\r\n\r\n'That's why we have families. If these people are as old as you say they are, then they have 2, 3 generations younger than them. I meet these people - you went to school with these people - they're brain surgeons. Okay? These are Asian Americans. they're smart, hard-working industrial people, addicted to the acquisition of real estate,' MacDonald said.\r\n\r\nWhen CBS 5 pointed out that MacDonald appeared to have generalized, painted with a broad brush, he said, 'I have. I'm just a private person, not a politician.'\"\r\n\r\nNo, Mr. MacDonald, you're not a politician. But that doesn't mean you're not a public figure, making a public case against these tenants, and giving an interview that may largely sway public opinion because you're the primary attorney working on this case and thus we trust you. And thus the fact that you're not a politician justifies the fact that you're backing up your case with egregious generalizations based on the tenants' race. Props, though, for owning up the bigoted flaws in your argument. |\\/|0|)31 |\\/|||\\|0R|7|35 F7W!!!!!1one\r\n\r\nAlso, what's with characterizing Asians as smart, hardworking, and \"addicted to the acquisition of real estate\"?? This to me is highly reminiscent of the whole Yellow Peril, the Chinaman is conspiring to take our California, pre-Chinese Exclusion crap, but maybe I'm just imagining things (maybe?).\r\n\r\n2) \"'There are only about three counties out of 60-something in California that give anything more than a 30-day notice,' said MacDonald. 'If we were in Daly City - if they were 110 years old - they would just get a 30-day notice. They don't get $15,000 in relocation money...How is it unfair for us to give $25,000 to move?

My local Borders didn't have it in stock, so I had to saunter a city over to a Barnes and Nobles to get access to it. I wasn't really sure what to expect because all I had really heard was that it was the coolest magazine out there and had an Asian culture focus. I prepared myself for the possibility of a presentation of overused Asian tropes and self-deprecating appreciation of Asian culture. As the little subtitle at the top of every issue says, \"Asian Pop Culture and Beyond\", Giant Robot was a magazine all about the culture that lay _beyond__ _most people's perception of \"Asian Culture\".\r\n\nWhat I loved (and still love) is that it never restricts itself. The editors, Martin Wong and Eric Nakamura in addition to its contributors, wrote and presented what interested them, what they thought deserved some attention, and what they thought would engage other people. It was about the art, the soul, and the vision that Asians (and not just Asians, anybody) could produce. Giant Robot was a source of inspiration for me to think outside the box, not to limit myself because of where I came from and who I am, and to be creative. It's about what you do, not who you think you are.\r\n\nGiant Robot also has a very grassroot-sy vibe to it where, although they can be a lil' critical and snarky, it wasn't based on pretension, but a passion for innovation, novelty, and aesthetic appreciation.\r\n\nSo I was very sad to find that they were struggling. I know its a small mag, but it didn't quite hit me until they recently sent out an email asking for readers to help keep them afloat in these tough economic times. Its hard for print media in a digital age where everything is so readily available on a small lit screen. I'm all for saving some paper, but newspapers, magazines, and even just bound books somehow mean more to me when its printed on paper (its also easier on the eyes). Rather than just being information in the air, but making their value tangible and in your hands. I don't know, that's just how I feel about these kinds of things. I suppose there's also a lurking fear in my mind that someday in the future all the servers of the world will break down and all the information we put on the internet and harddrives will disappear because we relied on digital storage too much (I'm thinking along the lines of Fahrenheit 451).\r\n\nAnyways, I don't want Giant Robot to die, or wither away in quality into inevitable oblivion. Initially I thought $60,000 was a lot, but when I really thought about it, it's an extremely modest amount considering print distribution costs, all the art shows and events they put on, and the traveling their contributors must do.\r\n\nSo if you have a few dollars to spare and would like to help Giant Robot stay strong (like that Gundam that releases steam and flashes in Japan), [please donate](http://www.giantrobot.com/donate).\r\n\nDon't die GR, don't die!!!","html":"<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-616\" title=\"giantrobot.jpg\" src=\"http://hardboiled.berkeley.edu/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/PC290069.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" /></p>\r\nMy sophomore year in high school was the first time I picked up an issue of Giant Robot at the magazine rack.

That it is known  colloquially as _Ngày Giải phóng _(Liberation Day) in  Vietnam  and _Tháng Tư Đen _(Black April) among the Vietnamese  everywhere else is a bitter reminder of the saddest irony of modern  Vietnamese history: that the romantic dream of liberation from the yolk  of colonialism could instead lead to the irreparable rupture of the  unity of the Vietnamese people. On this day, hundreds of thousands of  families who dared to dream more about feeding their children than to  revel in the deluded fantasies of powerful men they'd never met were  forced to make a decision that would alter the life trajectories of  millions of Vietnamese forever.\r\n\nShould we risk it all -- our lives, our livelihoods, our families,  our villages -- in order to find a better life in a foreign land where  we can't communicate with anyone other than the very people who were  forced to make the same heart-wrenching decision? Millions did, and yet  for thousands of these brave souls this dream was lost in the vastness  of the sea or in the onerousness of labor camps. Both of my parents had  to make this decision. My mother, in particular, pin-balled from island  to island -- alone -- for years before landing in Philadelphia, where  she had to wait three years before she could write a letter to her  family to let them know that they could take her picture off of the bàn  thờ, the family altar.\r\n\nIn nature, some seeds are designed to sprout after fire has  incinerated all else. What commonly rises from the ashes of the barren  landscape is a new, stronger grove of trees that grow up together,  united to face the onslaught of the coming winter storms. The overseas  Vietnamese community, in some ways, is the same way.

That it is known  colloquially as <em>Ngày Giải phóng </em>(Liberation Day) in  Vietnam  and <em>Tháng Tư Đen </em>(Black April) among the Vietnamese  everywhere else is a bitter reminder of the saddest irony of modern  Vietnamese history: that the romantic dream of liberation from the yolk  of colonialism could instead lead to the irreparable rupture of the  unity of the Vietnamese people. On this day, hundreds of thousands of  families who dared to dream more about feeding their children than to  revel in the deluded fantasies of powerful men they'd never met were  forced to make a decision that would alter the life trajectories of  millions of Vietnamese forever.\r\n\r\nShould we risk it all -- our lives, our livelihoods, our families,  our villages -- in order to find a better life in a foreign land where  we can't communicate with anyone other than the very people who were  forced to make the same heart-wrenching decision? Millions did, and yet  for thousands of these brave souls this dream was lost in the vastness  of the sea or in the onerousness of labor camps. Both of my parents had  to make this decision. My mother, in particular, pin-balled from island  to island -- alone -- for years before landing in Philadelphia, where  she had to wait three years before she could write a letter to her  family to let them know that they could take her picture off of the bàn  thờ, the family altar.\r\n\r\nIn nature, some seeds are designed to sprout after fire has  incinerated all else. What commonly rises from the ashes of the barren  landscape is a new, stronger grove of trees that grow up together,  united to face the onslaught of the coming winter storms. The overseas  Vietnamese community, in some ways, is the same way. United by the  sorrowful memories of a common ordeal, our parents and friends \"who left  it all behind\" have adjusted to this foreign environment have have come  out stronger because of it.\r\n\r\nI wrote this because I am in a reflective mood.

My exterior gives me away—the black hair, the olive skin, the almond-shaped eyes. Though I was born here and act American a girl as any, I am only what I appear.\r\n\nBut for years, I claimed—clung to, even—my American identity. I didn’t want to be the girl, 5’4″ with the thick, toneless American accent, the one relatives called gwai lo (鬼佬)—ghost person, white. I didn’t want to be the lost cause, the girl too American, a walking symbolic gesture of the Chinese culture that was to be lost with my generation.\r\n\nI couldn’t handle that burden.\r\n\nI remembered all too well that, in my sixth grade year, I bunked with three Chinese girls for science camp in the Santa Cruz mountains. We ate spaghetti in the mess hall, and while brushing our teeth and peering into the bathroom mirror to check our complexion, I confessed that I had never once used chopsticks; the fork was my tool of choice. Through the mirror, I saw their faces contort and I witnessed my own alienation. “How can you be so white-washed?” said one girl with braided pigtails and wire-framed glasses.\r\n\nLater that year, my mom handed me a book, with a missing cover and pages bound together by a single strip of yellow masking tape: a Cantonese how-to book in blocky serif. For weeks, I pored over characters, repeated phrases in my room, said I would be Chinese, wished so hard I once yelled at parents over dinner, “Why couldn’t you teach me?” Faces blank, they stared across the dinner table, before speaking softly, “But then you wouldn’t know English so well.” I folded my arms, and sunk into my seat.\r\n\nSomehow, I got to thinking that if I couldn’t be Asian, I could be American. I could be what I had always been—the girl in jeans and a tshirt, listening to rock music, dreaming of someday being a songwriter or an author.\r\n\nI thought these things, but when I was 21 and in Nevada, seven white boys looking no older than 12 biked by and yelled, “Asian domination! Go back to your own country!” There were folks around—all white, all older—but no one looked, didn’t even say a thing. I’ve never even been across the Pacific Ocean.\r\n\nStill, there were other reminders indicating that I did not conform to the traditional expectations of America—in magazine racks at the supermarket or while window-shopping in the City.

My exterior gives me away—the black hair, the olive skin, the almond-shaped eyes. Though I was born here and act American a girl as any, I am only what I appear.\r\n\r\nBut for years, I claimed—clung to, even—my American identity. I didn’t want to be the girl, 5’4″ with the thick, toneless American accent, the one relatives called gwai lo (鬼佬)—ghost person, white. I didn’t want to be the lost cause, the girl too American, a walking symbolic gesture of the Chinese culture that was to be lost with my generation.\r\n\r\nI couldn’t handle that burden.\r\n\r\nI remembered all too well that, in my sixth grade year, I bunked with three Chinese girls for science camp in the Santa Cruz mountains. We ate spaghetti in the mess hall, and while brushing our teeth and peering into the bathroom mirror to check our complexion, I confessed that I had never once used chopsticks; the fork was my tool of choice. Through the mirror, I saw their faces contort and I witnessed my own alienation. “How can you be so white-washed?” said one girl with braided pigtails and wire-framed glasses.\r\n\r\nLater that year, my mom handed me a book, with a missing cover and pages bound together by a single strip of yellow masking tape: a Cantonese how-to book in blocky serif. For weeks, I pored over characters, repeated phrases in my room, said I would be Chinese, wished so hard I once yelled at parents over dinner, “Why couldn’t you teach me?” Faces blank, they stared across the dinner table, before speaking softly, “But then you wouldn’t know English so well.” I folded my arms, and sunk into my seat.\r\n\r\nSomehow, I got to thinking that if I couldn’t be Asian, I could be American. I could be what I had always been—the girl in jeans and a tshirt, listening to rock music, dreaming of someday being a songwriter or an author.\r\n\r\nI thought these things, but when I was 21 and in Nevada, seven white boys looking no older than 12 biked by and yelled, “Asian domination! Go back to your own country!” There were folks around—all white, all older—but no one looked, didn’t even say a thing. I’ve never even been across the Pacific Ocean.\r\n\r\nStill, there were other reminders indicating that I did not conform to the traditional expectations of America—in magazine racks at the supermarket or while window-shopping in the City. A flip through a beauty magazine usually meant more years spent toying with makeup, uninstructed. Shopping at large retailers only meant needing to special order my petite-sized jeans.\r\n\r\nI once knew a girl who went card shopping for Father’s Day, looking specifically for a card featuring an Asian father. Having finally found a greeting card with an Asian baby on the cover, she flipped it open to find the words, “Congratulations on your adoption.”\r\n\r\nThus, still stands the definition of American that is left unspoken: one converging on white America.

The article is basically a reflection on a July 25 demonstration in Guangdong Province, China, during which over a thousand protestors (mostly young people) stood in opposition to a local politician’s recommendation to replace the Cantonese evening news with a Mandarin broadcast.

So rarely do we view or discuss language promotion as a form of epistemic marginalization. I argue that in this case, it definitely is. Over the course of this year, the New York Times ran a series of rather sensationalist articles about how Mandarin is eclipsing Cantonese in Chinatowns across the East Coast, and the historically important dialect is rapidly fading into linguistic oblivion. From my experience in New York, Cantonese is alive and well in Chinatown, as well as Fujianese (another widely spoken Southern dialect). The only reason why Cantonese might be considered a “dying language” is because community institutions are attempting to bludgeon it to death, curtailing Cantonese-language services and only offering Cantonese classes to little kids at Chinese schools (but only as a stepping stone to help them transition to learning Mandarin). This is not at all helped by the stigmatization of Cantonese as a non-legitimate slang language for uneducated people, as well as the mindset that (in the words of this awful woman I met at a family friend’s graduation party), “Mandarin is the unifying language of all Chinese.”  Mandarin the unifying language of all Chinese?

Not all Chinese are from China, and to make such an erroneous assumption glosses over the tremendous diversity of the Chinese American community and marginalizes those whose families do not identify as Mandarin-speakers. Due to their proximity to the sea, the Chinese from Southern China (where Cantonese and other related dialects are spoken) were the first to migrate overseas and set up diasporic communities. The predominant language in all historic American Chinatowns has always been Cantonese or Toisanese. The primary purpose of languages is communication, not only with other people, but also with our families and personal histories. I trace my roots to the Southern Chinese communities in the Philippines, and though I never got a chance to learn it, I’ve spent virtually all of my adolescent and young adult life in relentless pursuit of the language that used to belong to my family.

How dare you try to define my identity for me, as well as the collective identities of all Chinese Americans.**\r\n\nI do not aim to attack Mandarin or deter people from learning it. I instead argue the importance of preserving Cantonese and against the cultural homogenization of the Chinese community, as well as against the dearth of resources for young Canto people who want to learn about their heritage.

When looking at the handout that was given to us, a freshman woman asked, “Why does it say student fees and not tuition?”\r\n\nThe response, as the teach-in leader pointed out, was because legally since the UCs are public schools and state funded, they are not able to charge student “tuition fees;” however, the UC regents and Yudolf can sugarcoat the fuck out of the meaning and call it “fees.”  If you take a look at the various categories for these “fees” it gets quite ridiculous as to how many categories there actually are and how the less collectively useful it gets, the more money it seems to be allocated.\r\n\nIf one was to go online to check out the _University of California Student Fee Policy_ at [http://www.universtiyofcalifornia.edu/regents/policies/3101.html](http://www.universtiyofcalifornia.edu/regents/policies/3101.html) it clearly states that the “primary focus of Student Services Fee **should not** be on programs” such as the immediate office of the Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs, who nonetheless receives about $800,000; more than the total money allocated to the Student Learning Center (which received a whopping $8,871 in 2009-10) and the Student life Advising Services (which received $112,001 in 2009-10) combined!\r\n\nThe teach-in further explored the “California Master Plan” and it’s original three-tier system of Community Colleges, CSUs (California State Universities), and then the UCs at the top; all three of which would be largely (if not fully) funded by the state government. The intention of this “plan” was to make education accessible to all Californians, despite their economic backgrounds. Thus, for those that attended Community Colleges, the intention would be for them to eventually go on to CSUs and UCs.  The master plan lasted about ten years and officially fell out in 2004 when California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger and the UC regents decided to largely privatize the funding of the UC system.\r\n\nBy 10:15 AM, things started to look a little better and brighter with several congregations of teach-ins. There were about six groups of about eleven people; my own teach-in group had grown also to about ten people. Each teach-in group had different topics, all of which were relevant to the original intent of the walkout. Each topic was well-thought through and thoroughly internalized; the only fault would be the lack of people to tell the information to.\r\n\nThe problem with this logic though, is that the people that would benefit most from calling the UC Regents out on these fee hikes are often the one who are the most unwilling. This goes with the logic of how those that have the most to gain, also have the most to lose. Some deem the walkout/picketing not worth skipping a day of class which they pay $100+ dollars for. The fact of the matter is, these questions and concerns need to be thoroughly addressed in order to convince our fellow students that this fight is worth fighting for.","html":"As I approached Sproul Plaza and saw a group of about only twenty-one people picketing, my heart sank.

Li, who was born in Peru, is currently being held alone in Arizona and awaiting deportation to his birth country. His parents were since released and are awaiting potential deportation to China; however, ICE officials have neglected to explicate why Li was separated from his family. Li’s story is simply one of the expected 400,000 deportations that will be occurring this fiscal year, almost 10 percent over the Bush administration's 2008 total.\r\n\nWhile it is legally correct that the Li family broke the law in illicitly staying in San Francisco, their story illustrates that the law itself is inherently broken. Until his arrest, Li was unaware of his illegal status and simply attempting to live the tale of hard work and perseverance indoctrinated into every American. Li’s family did in fact previously attempt to gain documentation, but their petition for political asylum was denied in 2003 and in 2004. This case is a testament to the fractured immigration system that, on a quotidian basis, deals out inhumane treatment to a racialized underclass--including the prized “model minority” of stratified American society.\r\n\nAs Asian Americans and students at Berkeley, however, we do not aim to advocate for Li because he is a disempowered individual. Our outrage is predicated by the fact that Li is a student just like us and could have been anyone in our communities. According to a report by the University of California Office of the President, Asian/Pacific Islander students constitute 40-44% of undocumented students in the UC system. For obvious reasons, undocumented students of any race typically do not put their illegal statuses up for exhibition.

Li, who was born in Peru, is currently being held alone in Arizona and awaiting deportation to his birth country. His parents were since released and are awaiting potential deportation to China; however, ICE officials have neglected to explicate why Li was separated from his family. Li’s story is simply one of the expected 400,000 deportations that will be occurring this fiscal year, almost 10 percent over the Bush administration's 2008 total.\r\n\r\nWhile it is legally correct that the Li family broke the law in illicitly staying in San Francisco, their story illustrates that the law itself is inherently broken. Until his arrest, Li was unaware of his illegal status and simply attempting to live the tale of hard work and perseverance indoctrinated into every American. Li’s family did in fact previously attempt to gain documentation, but their petition for political asylum was denied in 2003 and in 2004. This case is a testament to the fractured immigration system that, on a quotidian basis, deals out inhumane treatment to a racialized underclass--including the prized “model minority” of stratified American society.\r\n\r\nAs Asian Americans and students at Berkeley, however, we do not aim to advocate for Li because he is a disempowered individual. Our outrage is predicated by the fact that Li is a student just like us and could have been anyone in our communities. According to a report by the University of California Office of the President, Asian/Pacific Islander students constitute 40-44% of undocumented students in the UC system. For obvious reasons, undocumented students of any race typically do not put their illegal statuses up for exhibition. Though we may not know who among our friends and classmates are next, we do know that unjust institutional factors constantly threaten members of our community whose struggles are most invisible.\r\n\r\nIt is imperative to recognize that Li’s case is not a historical juggernaut for our community.

Steve has been constantly lauded in the media as a prime example of a beneficiary for the DREAM Act, an act that would provide a pathway to legalization for undocumented students and undocumented individuals serving in the military, provided they fit certain criteria (see [http://www.dreamactivist.org/text-of-dream-act-legislation/general-faq/](http://www.dreamactivist.org/text-of-dream-act-legislation/general-faq/) for details).\r\n\nThough it's by no means a permanent solution (and it would be highly erroneous and detrimental to assume the passage of the DREAM Act would solve the problems and hardships felt by the undocumented community), this is a huge step in the right direction that would really help many of our friends and classmates, including the 40-44% of undocumented students in the UC system who are API. Thanks to Congress' lame duck session, the DREAM Act has come up for a vote THIS WEDNESDAY. Here are some things you can do to show your support:\r\n\n1) Sign on to the Asian American Justice Center's AAPI Student Sign-On Letter at [http://bit.ly/dreamaapi](http://bit.ly/dreamaapi) (this takes like 30 seconds)\r\n\n2) Call your HOR Representative or Senator:\r\n\nYou can make a simple call to the **House: 1-866-220-0044** or Senate**: (866) 996-5161 **and ask to be transfered to your Representative's* office.\r\n\nSearch for your Representative in the chart below by searching for your County and make a less-than-one-minute call saying:\r\n\n**Hi, my name is _____ and I'm a UC Berkeley student from _____ City/County.

Let's make this DREAM happen.","html":"With your help, we were able to delay Steve Li's deportation by prompting the intervention of Senator Dianne Feinstein, but it's still not over. Steve has been constantly lauded in the media as a prime example of a beneficiary for the DREAM Act, an act that would provide a pathway to legalization for undocumented students and undocumented individuals serving in the military, provided they fit certain criteria (see <a href=\"http://www.dreamactivist.org/text-of-dream-act-legislation/general-faq/\">http://www.dreamactivist.org/text-of-dream-act-legislation/general-faq/</a> for details).\r\n\r\nThough it's by no means a permanent solution (and it would be highly erroneous and detrimental to assume the passage of the DREAM Act would solve the problems and hardships felt by the undocumented community), this is a huge step in the right direction that would really help many of our friends and classmates, including the 40-44% of undocumented students in the UC system who are API. Thanks to Congress' lame duck session, the DREAM Act has come up for a vote THIS WEDNESDAY. Here are some things you can do to show your support:\r\n\r\n1) Sign on to the Asian American Justice Center's AAPI Student Sign-On Letter at <a href=\"http://bit.ly/dreamaapi\" target=\"_blank\">http://bit.ly/dreamaapi</a> (this takes like 30 seconds)\r\n\r\n2) Call your HOR Representative or Senator:\r\n\r\nYou can make a simple call to the <strong>House: 1-866-220-0044</strong> or Senate<strong>: (866) 996-5161 </strong>and ask to be transfered to your Representative's* office.\r\n\r\nSearch for your Representative in the chart below by searching for your County and make a less-than-one-minute call saying:\r\n\r\n<strong>Hi, my name is _____ and I'm a UC Berkeley student from _____ City/County. I’m calling to urge Representative _______ to vote YES on the DREAM Act when it comes up for a vote next week.

If not now, then when?\" – John Lewis_\r\n\nMy name is Ju Hong, and I am undocumented and unafraid.\r\n\nOn Tuesday, July 12, six other undocumented students and I conducted an act of civil disobedience to empower young undocumented immigrant youth and to protest the inhuman treatments of immigrants. We sat in the street nearby San Bernardino Valley College and submitted to arrest. We were taken to jail, and we are now being threatened with deportation. This is the first time in California, where undocumented youth participated in non-violent civil disobedience.\r\n\n&nbsp;\r\n\nWe chose to protest in San Bernardino County because organizations like the National Socialist Party (Nazis), the Minutemen, and anti-immigrant legislators have been terrorizing the immigrant communities. In San Bernardino, a 17-year old student was arrested and deported simply because he was riding his bike without the headlights on. Another student was arrested and deported because he was playing basketball on campus late at night. Where is the justice? Why are so many talented immigrant youth being targeted?\r\n\nAfter our arrest, we were held in jail for almost 12 hours. All seven of us were confined to a single cell room with one toilet, one roll of toilet paper, and two long wooden benches. It was very cold.\r\n\nOne of the youngest participants, 19-year-old student Jorge Herrera, led the unity clap inside the cell. With our eyes closed, everyone followed by the rhythm of the clap. I shouted, ‘Isang Bagsak!’ a Filipino unity cry, “one down, one fall!” – meaning we must stand together and fight for justice. Even in jail, the room was filled with energy and strong determination.\r\n\nSeveral hours later, an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officer came to our cell to interrogate us. The ICE agent looked directly at me and said, “I will not detain you today, but I will detain you soon.” In reality, the ICE agent has the authority to deport us, to separate us from our family and friends, and to send us to a country that is foreign to us.\r\n\nICE was notified because of the “secure communities” program that allows local law enforcement to share information with ICE to initiate deportation proceedings. This is an unjust program, because it leaves immigrant communities vulnerable and distrustful of the police.\r\n\nA year ago, my family’s home was burglarized. The door was broken into pieces, the windows were completely shattered, and our valuable belongings were gone. All of my family was terrified. My immediate reaction was to call the police, but my mother stopped me, “Ju, do not call the police,” she said. “What if you get deported?”\r\n\nLike many other undocumented immigrants, I was living in the shadows and living in a constant fear of deportation. However, I have decided to stand up and fight back. I am sick and tired of remaining silent. Today, I am proclaiming to the world that I am undocumented and unafraid.\r\n\nIn the next couple of weeks, I will find out if ICE will start removal proceedings on our cases. If ICE decides to put me in deportation proceedings, I will take full action and I will fight until I regain my basic human rights.\r\n\nI risked my life because I wanted to empower other young undocumented youth. In particular, I strongly encourage my fellow Asian American undocumented youth to take the next step and come out of the shadows. Start sharing your personal story to your friends, your relatives, your counselors, and your communities. This is only way we can empower our communities and fix our broken immigration system.\r\n\nI risked my life because I wanted to show that this is not only a Latino issue; in fact, this is a human rights issue. I hope we can stand united as a movement, and not let divisions hurt our work.\r\n\nWe are calling on President Barack Obama to stop the deportation of all undocumented students throughout the country. Please join us.\r\n\nThis is our home, this is our country, and we want to contribute to make this nation a better place.\r\n\nYou can make our dreams come true.  Thank you.\r\n\nIsang Bagsak,\r\n\nJu Hong","html":"<strong>STATEMENT BY JU HONG</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>UC BERKELEY DREAM ACT STUDENT</strong>\r\n\r\n<em>“If not us, then who?

And you can bet your ass that I was pissed when I couldn’t make Jane Lynch’s book signing on campus last fall. “Glee” is notorious for pushing the envelope when it comes to challenging the preconceived notions of what we regard as acceptable. Storylines revolve around same-sex couples, interracial couples and a female football coach to boot- tackling everything from homosexuality to traditional gender roles. The show manages to produce amazing musical numbers filmed on incredible sets week after week, but its unconventional relationships and controversial storylines are what convinced me that this was not just “another teen show”. The show brought something refreshing and original audiences hadn’t seen before. People were finally talking about topics that were traditionally off-limits. That’s why last Tuesday night’s episode, \"The Spanish Teacher\" was such a damn disappointment. At the end of Mr. Shue’s mariachi number, a furious Santana whaled on Mr. Shue, screaming “why don’t you just dress up as the taco bell Chihuahua and bark the theme song to ‘Dora the Explorer’? You don’t even know enough to be embarrassed about these stereotypes you’re perpetuating.” As I watched this scene, I felt some indignant anger of my own. Santana clearly felt wronged for the way her ethnicity was being portrayed and her outrage was understandable, to say the least. However, for a show that prides itself on challenging every stereotype imaginable, the writers seemed to have completely missed the point by doing the exact opposite with Mike Chang’s character on the episode, \"Asian F\". They had no problem depicting him as an overachieving pre-med Asian student who is dutifully fulfilling his tiger dad’s unyielding expectations that he become a well-to-do, successful doctor. It seems that every stereotype is worth defying except for the ones concerning Asians. Somehow that one needs to be perpetuated to no end. Why is it that the Asian always gets left behind?  I still admire the show for its aesthetic qualities, but it’s inexcusable that Asian stereotypes continue to be reinforced this way, especially with a hit show like “Glee”. When you create admirable characters that stand up to the dickheads misrepresenting their people, you better make sure they’re standing up for _everyone_, not just races you feel are worth defending. What a fucking fail on your part.","html":"It’s no secret that I’m avid fan of the t.v. show Glee.  Much to the disgruntled ears of my male roommate, I blast their songs like there’s no tomorrow.

Except for the fact that many Asian American subgroups, including half a million Hmong, have spontaneously combusted, the survey did manage to reach about 3,500 Asian Americans, with more than 500 devoted to each of the six subgroup (Chinese, Indian, Filipino, Japanese, Vietnamese, Korean). Moreover, the survey did have a plethora of questions and responses so when in doubt, [always go back to examine the raw data](http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/files/2012/06/SDT-Rise-of-Asian-Americans-Topline-Questionnaire.pdf).\r\n\nHowever, the Pew report and many others have concluded that Asian Americans are some type of high-achieving, wealthy, cybernetic, adamantium-boned super duper supermen!!!\r\n\nJA, WE ARE DIE ÜBERMENSCH!!!! ACHTUNG!!!\r\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_2393\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"480\" caption=\"Der face of die Asian Superman\"][![](http://hardboiled.berkeley.edu/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/IMG_0164.jpg \"IMG_0164\")](http://hardboiled.berkeley.edu/2012/06/21/asian_supermen_lol/img_0164/)[/caption]\r\n\nFrom the report, bloggers have concluded that Asian are quote [\"the superior race.\" ](http://djchuang.wordpress.com/2012/06/19/new-research-suggests-asians-are-in-fact-the-superior-race-in-the-u-s/)The report says that Asians are more wealthy than every other race. This is not true given the fact that Pew (and other researchers) have used median household income to calculate wealth. This doesn't exactly work because Asian families tend to have more income earners. In addition, Asian tend to live on the coasts where the cost of living, and therefore wages, are generally higher. Plus, factors like the \"bamboo ceiling\" may prevent very high incomes among Asian Americans, which can't be represented through median household income.\r\n\nThe Asian Americans being happier with themselves and the state of the nation may not be true. Remember, Asian Americans live in places like the Silicon Valley and New York where the satisfaction with how the country is going and their own lives is better than the American Heartland. If Asians started to congregate on Youngstown, Ohio, the answers maybe different. Moreover, satisfaction with how the nation is doing might be linked to the fact that Asian lean democrat and we have a Barack Obama in office, which is illustrated by Obama's approval by Asians as stated in the same report. In addition, the report fails to state mental health issues within the Asian American community, like the fact that young Asian American women have the highest rates of depression.\r\n\nThe study explicitly wanted to test the Amy Chua hypothesis if Asians or \"Americans\" place too much to succeed academically. The study found that more than half of BOTH Asian Americans and \"Americans\" think that \"Americans\" put not enough pressure for their kids to succeed academically and only 10% thought they put too much pressure.

Danke.","html":"<a href=\"http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/files/2012/06/SDT-The-Rise-of-Asian-Americans-Full-Report.pdf\">The Pew Research Center has developed *gasp* startling new conclusions on Asian Americans!!!</a> Something about Asian Americans being better educated, wealthier, more likely to integrate, blah blah blah blah blah.\r\n\r\nTo give the Pew report some credit, they are generally pretty thorough and professional  at creating the survey and gathering the data. Except for the fact that many Asian American subgroups, including half a million Hmong, have spontaneously combusted, the survey did manage to reach about 3,500 Asian Americans, with more than 500 devoted to each of the six subgroup (Chinese, Indian, Filipino, Japanese, Vietnamese, Korean). Moreover, the survey did have a plethora of questions and responses so when in doubt, <a href=\"http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/files/2012/06/SDT-Rise-of-Asian-Americans-Topline-Questionnaire.pdf\">always go back to examine the raw data</a>.\r\n\r\nHowever, the Pew report and many others have concluded that Asian Americans are some type of high-achieving, wealthy, cybernetic, adamantium-boned super duper supermen!!!\r\n\r\nJA, WE ARE DIE ÜBERMENSCH!!!! ACHTUNG!!!\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_2393\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"480\" caption=\"Der face of die Asian Superman\"]<a href=\"http://hardboiled.berkeley.edu/2012/06/21/asian_supermen_lol/img_0164/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-2393\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-2393 \" title=\"IMG_0164\" src=\"http://hardboiled.berkeley.edu/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/IMG_0164.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"480\" height=\"640\" /></a>[/caption]\r\n\r\nFrom the report, bloggers have concluded that Asian are quote <a href=\"http://djchuang.wordpress.com/2012/06/19/new-research-suggests-asians-are-in-fact-the-superior-race-in-the-u-s/\">\"the superior race.\" </a>The report says that Asians are more wealthy than every other race. This is not true given the fact that Pew (and other researchers) have used median household income to calculate wealth. This doesn't exactly work because Asian families tend to have more income earners. In addition, Asian tend to live on the coasts where the cost of living, and therefore wages, are generally higher. Plus, factors like the \"bamboo ceiling\" may prevent very high incomes among Asian Americans, which can't be represented through median household income.\r\n\r\nThe Asian Americans being happier with themselves and the state of the nation may not be true. Remember, Asian Americans live in places like the Silicon Valley and New York where the satisfaction with how the country is going and their own lives is better than the American Heartland. If Asians started to congregate on Youngstown, Ohio, the answers maybe different. Moreover, satisfaction with how the nation is doing might be linked to the fact that Asian lean democrat and we have a Barack Obama in office, which is illustrated by Obama's approval by Asians as stated in the same report. In addition, the report fails to state mental health issues within the Asian American community, like the fact that young Asian American women have the highest rates of depression.\r\n\r\nThe study explicitly wanted to test the Amy Chua hypothesis if Asians or \"Americans\" place too much to succeed academically. The study found that more than half of BOTH Asian Americans and \"Americans\" think that \"Americans\" put not enough pressure for their kids to succeed academically and only 10% thought they put too much pressure. However, 40% of Asian Americans thought that people in their respective ethnic groups place too much pressure on education (although only 20% of Filipinos and Japanese thought their ethnic group placed too much pressure on education). <strong>However</strong>, what this tells ME is that Asian Americans are self-aware about how much pressure they are putting on children academically, and in the future, parents and future parents will lessen this pressure and allow children to cultivate other aspects of their lives.\r\n\r\nIn addition, academic success doesn't always mean success in the long run.

Both of these men have been highly visible in the API community through their work as Berkeley alumni, activists, and educators. Both took part in the 1969 third world Liberation Front protest movements that formed at Cal and San Francisco State University, and as a student of Harvey's last spring semester, I benefited from the sacrifices former students had made in the struggle to build ethnic studies programs.\r\n\nBefore I came to Berkeley, I knew nothing about the struggle to establish academic departments that focused on the history of minorities. Only in Asian American Studies 20B did I learn more in-depth how the \"passive\" community stood up to voice its demands for public education and social justice, and I am inspired the experience that Harvey brings to his work.\r\n\nAlthough I only heard about Richard Aoki long after his death in 2009, the contributions he had made as a student leader in the face of extreme opposition marked him as someone I could relate to after I being involved in the Occupy Cal protest last year. Now, with journalist Seth Rosenfeld claiming in his book _Subversives: The FBI's War on Student Radicals, and Reagan's Rise to Power_ that Aoki was a paid FBI informant, I am at a loss as to what I still believe. In this time of doubt over Aoki's true identity, I know that the community has not wavered in its response to Rosenfeld's findings, and Ethnic Studies students at Berkeley especially have a stake in the ongoing debate.\r\n\nFrom what I saw with members of **hardboiled** at the event hosted by the Graduate School of Journalism on Wednesday, September 19, Rosenfeld stuck to the facts as he presented them, without offering much room for opinion. He seemed confident in his knowledge of Aoki's history and career.\r\n\nI would like to ignore the fact that he initially ignored me when I approached him after the conversation, shaking his hand and smiling as I introduced myself. What I will not ignore is that the same journalist who tirelessly pursued five lawsuits under the Freedom of Information Act was never able to conduct more than two telephone interviews with Aoki, none in person. In response to my question on whether Aoki's condition prevented him from meeting with Rosenfeld one-on-one, Rosenfeld said, \"I don't know.\" I guess that as long as Aoki was alive, Rosenfeld could do little with the cryptic responses he was able to draw out. Granted, Rosenfeld deserves credit for doing the research and analysis, but ultimately his statement of Aoki leaves much to the imagination. Why include Aoki in the book if no concrete, comprehensive data shows what type of information he passed on (if he did work as an informant) to the FBI?\r\n\nMuch remains to be uncovered in the Richard Aoki case, but for those who have known him as a friend, leader, and role model, his standing in the API community will continue to be upheld, even as his right to privacy has diminished.","html":"[youtube http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOWR3ArCEqI&amp;w=640&amp;h=360]\r\n\r\nI recognized two faces in this video: those of Richard Aoki and Harvey Dong. Both of these men have been highly visible in the API community through their work as Berkeley alumni, activists, and educators. Both took part in the 1969 third world Liberation Front protest movements that formed at Cal and San Francisco State University, and as a student of Harvey's last spring semester, I benefited from the sacrifices former students had made in the struggle to build ethnic studies programs.\r\n\r\nBefore I came to Berkeley, I knew nothing about the struggle to establish academic departments that focused on the history of minorities. Only in Asian American Studies 20B did I learn more in-depth how the \"passive\" community stood up to voice its demands for public education and social justice, and I am inspired the experience that Harvey brings to his work.\r\n\r\nAlthough I only heard about Richard Aoki long after his death in 2009, the contributions he had made as a student leader in the face of extreme opposition marked him as someone I could relate to after I being involved in the Occupy Cal protest last year. Now, with journalist Seth Rosenfeld claiming in his book <em>Subversives: The FBI's War on Student Radicals, and Reagan's Rise to Power</em> that Aoki was a paid FBI informant, I am at a loss as to what I still believe. In this time of doubt over Aoki's true identity, I know that the community has not wavered in its response to Rosenfeld's findings, and Ethnic Studies students at Berkeley especially have a stake in the ongoing debate.\r\n\r\nFrom what I saw with members of <strong>hardboiled</strong> at the event hosted by the Graduate School of Journalism on Wednesday, September 19, Rosenfeld stuck to the facts as he presented them, without offering much room for opinion. He seemed confident in his knowledge of Aoki's history and career.\r\n\r\nI would like to ignore the fact that he initially ignored me when I approached him after the conversation, shaking his hand and smiling as I introduced myself. What I will not ignore is that the same journalist who tirelessly pursued five lawsuits under the Freedom of Information Act was never able to conduct more than two telephone interviews with Aoki, none in person. In response to my question on whether Aoki's condition prevented him from meeting with Rosenfeld one-on-one, Rosenfeld said, \"I don't know.\" I guess that as long as Aoki was alive, Rosenfeld could do little with the cryptic responses he was able to draw out.

Suffice it to say, Aoki was pretty iconic for the Asian American activist community. After all, not only was he an activist in the Third World Liberation Front (TWLF), but also helped start the Black Panther Party.\r\n\nFor me, Aoki was a hero. He stood with other great activists like Martin Luther King Jr., or Cesar Chavez Jr. He was a badass. Not only did he join the military to serve his country, fought for equality for people of color via Third World Liberation Front but he was also involved with the Black Panther Party. In August, when Seth Rosenfeld was getting ready to release his book, _Subversives: The FBI’s War on Student Radicals, and Reagan’s Rise to Power_, he released information that Aoki was an informant for the FBI. The Asian American community was confused. I know I was. News sources at the time were only reporting the same information: Aoki was an FBI informant. Dismayed, I was hoping that his friends could give me insight whether or not this information was true.\r\n\nSo I sought out Harvey Dong, a friend of Aoki. He was interviewed by Seth Rosenfeld and started his own research when he found about Rosenfeld’s allegation. Harvey had only scratched the surface in finding out information about Aoki. I got to see a couple of pages of the papers that implied that Aoki was an informant. These pages were mostly redacted (thick lines that cover up information) and therefore a bit confusing to interpret. Without hard evidence that Aoki was an informant, I hoped that the allegations were false.\r\n\nA couple of months have passed since the allegations. The Asian American community, especially those who knew Richard, demanded more information and more information is becoming available. There are many files that have not been released to the public and are going through a process so that they can be made available, particularly after November 1st. The information that is currently out there tends to confirm Aoki as an informant. When more information becomes available, who knows how the story will change.\r\n\nMaybe he really was not an informant, or the information will reaffirm that he was. Let us assume he was one. What kind of informant was he? Was he one that truly believed that the movement that he was a part of truly malicious, or was something else going on? I will have a harder time believing the former, as he became, as described by a chapter in Diane Fujino’s _Samurai Among Panther_, an “advocate for the students.”  Regardless of his informant status, he taught critical social issues, provided academic counseling to marginalized students and leadership to his colleagues. (Fujino 257) He is still one of many heroes of the TWLF movement. Still, he is human. Even with the blemishes, he will still be a positive icon in my eyes and hopefully, in the Asian American and other communities as well.","html":"With the last issue of hardboiled focused on Richard Aoki, I thought I would take the time to talk about him as well.

The greater irony is that McInnes, in his hopes to highlight and challenge privilege, actually falls victim to the very thing he is standing against. McInnes can afford to write an ironic article that uses examples of “Asian privilege” as a rhetorical launching point, but not everyone has the luxury of seeing it thus. For my friends who read the article and immediately posted their 140-character rebuttal on Twitter, McInnes’ article is not mere satire; it stings.\r\n\nThe same holds true for other feeble attempts at racial satire. UC Berkeley students remember well the Affirmative Action Bakesale. Despite our value for free speech, there is a clear difference between good and thoughtful satire and a satire that is destructive and assholish. People who, even with the best intentions, do thoughtless things in the name of racial free speech must be willing to deal with the harm they cause, with the communities they insult. And “It’s just a joke, stop taking it so seriously.” does not count as an apology.\r\n\nMcInnes’ article hit too close to home and was not quite ridiculous enough. But why should I have expected him to anticipate how Asian Americans would feel about his article? He has no framework for our consciousness, no understanding of how his salty words fall into the open wounds of our community. Many of my friends went on the defensive after the first two paragraphs; of course I don’t blame them for pushing back on their Facebook statuses and blogs.\r\n\nGavin McInnes, you’ve clearly done your research, I don’t doubt your good intentions, but please do not use us as a chess piece in your exposition on privilege.

I recently interviewed Dean and Jordan from Made In Asia NYC, two Filipino-American entertainers from New York City. You can check out their videos [here](http://www.youtube.com/user/MadeInAsiaNYC/)!\r\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHJC7Cy7kVs\r\n\n_Tell us a little about yourselves._\r\n\n**Dean**: I’m Dean Banting. I graduated from the City College of New York with a Bachelors Degree in Fine Arts and Film and Video production. I’m a filmmaker and some of my favorite directors are Quentin Tarantino, Christopher Nolan, and Martin Scorsese. I love to make all kinds of films, but if you’ve seen our channel, Made In Asia NYC, a lot of it deals with relationships and girlfriends.\r\n\n**Jordan**: My name is Jordan De Los Reyes. I actually handle all of the marketing and PR stuff so any of the posts that you see on Facebook or Twitter— that’s me right there.\r\n\n_How did you two meet?_\r\n\n**Jordan**: I’ve known Dean for a long time. He’s actually a good friend of my brother’s. I’m turning 29 next week and Dean is turning 24; he and my brother are the same age. **Dean**: Yeah, I think [we’ve known each other since] we were six years old.\r\n\n_How did you come up with Made In Asia NYC?_\r\n\n**Jordan**: The name itself, well it’s pretty funny, we really didn’t know what we were going to call ourselves and were going through a couple of names. While Dean was working on a script or something he was like, “Why don’t you come up with a list of names?” So I gave him a list and it was a whole bunch of different things like “Dean and Jordy TV”, “Filipino Guys”, “Adobo Boys” and stuff like that. One of the names was Made In Asia NYC and that was the one Dean picked. He felt like that it was the best one and the one that stuck out to him.\r\n\n**Dean**: I checked the iPad and scrolled down the list of names and it just rolled off the tip of my tongue. I felt that I could hear other people say “Made in Asia NYC” and [that] it fit perfectly. We started the channel because in December of last year, I quit my full time job though I was doing video editing. At my old job I wasn’t meeting any of my personal goals, like to become a feature film director. Filmmaking was really my passion. With the full time job, even though it was a 9-5, living in NY it was more like 8-7 because the commute was crazy— it was an hour away. I didn’t have the time to do my own filmmaking so I decided to quit my own job and do freelance. Around the same time, Jordan was laid off of his job at Superdry as a Project Manager. I was watching those “Inside the Actors” videos and doing research on what was going on in the current industry. One of the stars up there was Bradley Cooper so I put up a status saying  “I want to work with Bradley Cooper in the future.” Jordy commented saying, “Why don’t you work with me first?” I sent him a message, “Hey man let’s meet up and discuss what you want to do.” So this whole YouTube thing, we talked about a long time ago, maybe three or four years ago; we had great ideas but our ideas never pulled through. In January we met up and were meeting up almost everyday that month to work on our stuff. That’s how Made In Asia NYC was born.\r\n\n**Jordan**: It was all destiny, fate, and the perfect timing. Everything just kind of fell together\r\n\n_Why YouTube?_\r\n\n**Dean**: A friend of mine who is also on YouTube, (his name is _Vijay Nazareth_, his channel is AVByte) mentioned to me that in his opinion, YouTube was the new platform for independent filmmakers. Instead of going the traditional route, he felt that there was an audience there that was just waiting to be tapped into. Being a filmmaker myself, I decided that maybe this was a good platform for people to see our work. Lo and behold, our first views reached 3,000 people. I was like, “Wow, my first short video I did for school didn’t even reach a thousand people until I got it into festivals.” I see YouTube with so much potential; YouTube is big in the Asian community, so I thought it was good to show people that we are Asian filmmakers.\r\n\n_Are there any other YouTube artists that influence your work?_\r\n\n**Jordan**: Actually a lot of people. We received tons of comments that say we remind them of Wong Fu. Wong Fu does a lot of lighthearted short films and skits, and we take that as a compliment. There is no one here in the East Coast that does the same work that we’re doing, so people consider us as the Wong Fu of the East Coast, but actually they’re our biggest inspiration\r\n\n**Dean**: Ryan Higa, KevJumba. Their humor also definitely inspires us, [because] aside us from doing short films about love and all that, we also want to incorporate the same kind of humor that Ryan Higa and KevJumba have in their channels too.\r\n\n_Who do you want to collaborate with and why?_\r\n\n**Dean**: Definitely Lana Mc Kissack, [who is] a YouTuber as well. We think she’s fantastic as an actress and [has] personality. She’s definitely one I would like to collaborate with.\r\n\n**Jordan**: I would love to get Kina Grannis to be in one of our videos. She was also on Wong Fu, and she’s really good. She’s a good singer and can act.\r\n\n**Dean**: And every A-list actor and actress out there.\r\n\n**Jordan**: Yeah, we’ll just take them all.","html":"<em></em>Hey <strong>hardboiled</strong>!

As students who have been through high school and are currently pursuing higher education through the college route, we realize that an important factor to staying motivated, creating goals, and having dreams for yourself is understanding that you have the potential to achieve whatever it is that you want. Many times, we see the lack of determination because many may think that they have nothing to contribute when in reality, everyone has something to contribute. Not knowing you have potential is in some ways the same as believing that you have no potential; and so acknowledging your strengths and abilities allows you to do more with what you can, instead of dwelling on things that you believe you can’t. Success starts with building onto the qualities and abilities that each individual has. Whether this be academically, socially, culturally, or religiously, knowing you have the potential to reach your goals and dreams will always lead you further than believing that you do not have the abilities to achieve what you want.

Originally from Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, and now based in Taipei, Shia wears multiple hats as an artist, from organizing hip hop and live music events to overseeing the label [PPF House](http://ppfhouse.com/) with his brothers to producing with creative collective [the BLAST](http://theblastlife.com/). In this interview, Shia shares his thoughts on the rising interest towards hip hop in Taiwan and how family is at the heart of his work as an artist.\r\n\n<span style=\"font-size: x-small;\">*This will be the first in a series of interviews conducted by </span><span style=\"font-size: xx-small;\">**hardboiled**</span><span style=\"font-size: x-small;\"> staffer Sam Lai during her time in Taipei this summer. A little bit from Sam: </span><span style=\"font-size: x-small;\">I first came across LEO37 on [Angry Asian Man](http://blog.angryasianman.com/2011/11/music-video-fanfare-by-leo37.html) when the Fanfare music video was posted. What struck me the most was seeing a Taiwanese face not only rapping, but also rapping in a way that stood out from the hypermasculine Asian American hip hop artists I had seen. At the time, I had no idea that I would end up [meeting both Phil Yu](http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m6566sApze1rqmmq4o4_500.jpg) the Angry Asian Man and LEO37 in the next three years. PERKS OF BEING ASIAN AND A WRITER WOOT.</span>\r\n\n**So you’ve been in Taiwan for eight years?** [edit: Shia has been in the hip hop game for eight years. Sam needs to do better research.]\n\nNo no, three years. I did a tour around Asia with my good friends MAGNOLIUS (Toronto-based Hip-Hop group), back in ‘06, and that was the first time I’d been back as an adult: last time I was back I was 11. I was able to experience a lot, since a lot had changed. Back home, for independent Asian rappers, we were doing okay, had day jobs, but you start to see a roof. When I began to see some of my more favored counterparts and colleagues get deals, some major label, but see them struggle, I thought I’d give it a shot out here. I started going back and forth for several years, and three years ago finally made the move [to Taipei].\n\n**What's a regular day for LEO37 look like?**\r\n\nAs an independent artist, there's nothing regular. Nowadays, independent artists, they have hands in everything. They have to multi-task and be a lot more business minded. Pseudo-entrepreneurs if you will. My day-to-day, it depends. I do a lot of graphic design work, promotion: me and my two brothers (Howie and Tim) run PPF in Toronto and I have the Blast (Serpico, Poppa Baer and Oohchild) out here in Taipei. So it’s different depending on the day. Obviously I'd like to be writing a lot more considering that’s my technical job description and I have three different projects in three different countries that need finishing, but unfortunately, I can’t be in the studio every day.\n\n**What's your approach to writing like?**\n\n<object width=\"560\" height=\"315\" classid=\"clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000\" codebase=\"http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0\"><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\" /><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\" /><param name=\"src\" value=\"//www.youtube.com/v/2EnCEyZaSZM?hl=en_US&amp;version=3&amp;rel=0\" /><param name=\"allowfullscreen\" value=\"true\" /><embed width=\"560\" height=\"315\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/v/2EnCEyZaSZM?hl=en_US&amp;version=3&amp;rel=0\" allowFullScreen=\"true\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" /></object>\r\n\nMy brother Howie, he did the videos for \"FANFARE,\" \"YOU &amp; THE NITE,\" produced for my first two albums, did all the artwork for all my physical and digital releases, and he's a songwriter as well. He's worked harder at his craft than anyone I know. He’s the reason I know how to do graphic design and he’s the reason why I approach writing the way I do now. When he started working professionally, he told me there was no time to wait for inspiration, you have to treat it like a job. So when I have time I force myself to write.

Myself, I was always in the live music circle, I was never a club guy ever. [BLAST members] Poppa Baer and Serpico were spinning more in the clubs out here (as well as everywhere else), we added Oohchild later on, whose footprint in the street art community is extremely deep. Everyone had their foothold in different circles, and we tried to combine all our pros into something positive for the community.\n\nThanks to Serpico, we got started with Under Bridge that went on for almost a year [2012-2013], but then there was just a bunch of scheduling conflicts so we couldn't continue. It was like 150 to 300 kids every Sunday, while they got to hang out [and] listen to hip hop. The vibe that I got from that was what I got when I started. We had that for the kids. We did Nike summer nights, their first big streetball tournament in Taiwan, they had us take care of all the programming outside of the basketball.  It was amazing: five weeks, every week packed.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_3643\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"584\"][![Nike Summer Nights @ Ximending Movie Park, July to August 2012  PC: The BLAST website](http://hardboiled.berkeley.edu/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Nike-Summer-Nights-2012-1024x693.jpg)](http://hardboiled.berkeley.edu/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Nike-Summer-Nights-2012.jpg) Nike Summer Nights @ Ximending Movie Park, July to August 2012\nPC: The BLAST website[/caption]\r\n\n**Can you talk more about _Do You Want More_?**\n\n<object width=\"560\" height=\"315\" classid=\"clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000\" codebase=\"http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0\"><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\" /><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\" /><param name=\"src\" value=\"//www.youtube.com/v/59adCeahs6I?hl=en_US&amp;version=3&amp;rel=0\" /><param name=\"allowfullscreen\" value=\"true\" /><embed width=\"560\" height=\"315\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/v/59adCeahs6I?hl=en_US&amp;version=3&amp;rel=0\" allowFullScreen=\"true\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" /></object>\r\n\n_Do You Want More?_ had a live band and guests, and it was hugely successful for everyone who went. We started to do them monthly, add more guests, do more covers, live remixes, classic hip hop, funk R&amp;B, the momentum kept going. It was the most successful live music event in Taiwan. We felt we kind of plateaued, so we changed it down to a quarterly event in order to make each one a little more special. DYWM became a cultural hub where you saw different cliques and scenes coming together to enjoy good live music. It’s really a special event.\n\nIt’s crazy because when we brought Icy Ice of the Beat Junkies [_DJ crew formed in 1992 in Orange County_], he told us, _Yo it's crazy cuz the vibe you guys have here is what it felt like for us 15-20 years ago_. But here, the skill level isn't there yet, and it's absolutely not at the fault of the Taiwanese artists. It's still a new culture, they haven't heard enough. The new kids now who are coming into an environment where they've been listening to hip hop, they're catching it faster than the older guys who are trying to maintain, it’s exciting.\n\n**What would you describe your style of music as?**\n\nIt’s not hip hop, but it is hip hop. Because of the internet these days, regional hip-hop is less and less evident. So it just depends what you’re around and what inspires you. You got people like ASAP Rocky who sound like Houston but are from New York. I mean, ASAP Rocky grew up in New York, but the Houston sound, that’s what New York radio was playing. It was organic. For me, depending on the producers I’m working with, wherever I am in the world, or what stage in my life I’m at, that will influence what sound I create.  But I still like to think my work, no matter how far it gets, is still Hip-Hop.\n\nAs the only Chinese kid in class, I didn’t have rapper or DJ friends, I was an anomaly in my grade. But you know, while all the kids were listening to what they were, and I was listening the same things too, there’s something about being a yellow kid in a pretty much white kids school [in that] hip hop just speaks to you. I was experiencing racism on a regular basis, maybe not outright but little slights here and there. I started getting an inkling of it, once I started touring outside Canada, I started to see…but I truly believe there’s no outright racism, it’s ingrained. At the end of the day, I only had three role models in mainstream media growing up that looked like me: Bruce Lee, Jackie Chan, Dragon Ball Z. I was never a huge fan of Jackie just cause he, more often than not always ended up being a clown. And Dragon Ball Z is a cartoon. So you’re telling me that the last real male role model that I related to cuturally was 40 years ago? And I wasn’t really old enough for [Bruce Lee] to be my role model as a kid. It’s a weird scenario when you grow up in a climate where there was no one Asian to look up to. The Asian performers I saw seemed real cheesy to me where I was, and that wasn’t anything I wanted to be. I understand why people wouldn’t identify with Asian rappers. Not saying my lyrics are Asian-driven but there’s a perspective [the audience] doesn’t have and needs to be able to identify with my music. So I don’t blame anyone. But building and growing a career in Canada was tough. There are good Asian rappers really struggling in the States too, so it made sense that I came to Taiwan and test the waters.\n\n**What’s a challenge you’ve faced in coming to Taiwan?**\n\n<object width=\"560\" height=\"315\" classid=\"clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000\" codebase=\"http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0\"><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\" /><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\" /><param name=\"src\" value=\"//www.youtube.com/v/hEhwH4G_2PI?hl=en_US&amp;version=3&amp;rel=0\" /><param name=\"allowfullscreen\" value=\"true\" /><embed width=\"560\" height=\"315\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/v/hEhwH4G_2PI?hl=en_US&amp;version=3&amp;rel=0\" allowFullScreen=\"true\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" /></object>\r\n\nLanguage is still a problem, I don't speak it at a level that I need it to be. When I'm on stage, I wish I had more to say. I'm getting better. My banter is not that good, and I keep the shows tight cuz I don’t say much. Rather than show my weaknesses, I just push my strengths. The fact that I don't rap in Chinese and refuse to (until it’s at the level of my English) restricts my reach, so I promote and tour always with a band, because at least people can understand music and feeling, you [can] get that. For me, being out here, not only in Taiwan but being in Asia, with the exception of Singapore and the Philippines, everywhere else that doesn’t speak English has forced me to step my stage game up. The challenge keeps things interesting.\n\n**Would you say that Taiwan is still in the early stage of its hip hop scene?**\r\n\nIt is an early stage in Taiwan for hip hop: if hip hop started in 1976 or ‘78 in the US, then in Taiwan we’re in the late 80s right now. [Rappers here] are starting to rap more about things they care about, rather than just being cool at the party, so that’s refreshing, but it’s still in its early stages.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_3648\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"500\"][![Hip hop in the Bronx at the Dixie Club PC: Joe Conzo/WNYC](http://hardboiled.berkeley.edu/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Hip-hop-in-the-Bronx-at-the-Dixie-Club.jpg)](http://www.wnyc.org/story/89709-south-bronx-hip-hop-year-zero/) Hip hop in the Bronx at the Dixie Club.\nPC: Joe Conzo/WNYC[/caption]\r\n\n**Of course, hip hop is more than just rapping. How has the reception been for the other elements like DJing, graffiti, and break-dancing?**\n\nDance by nature in Taiwan is rich: other than b-boying, both popping and locking are huge and Taiwan remain international leaders in both. I appreciate what is growing out here, so I’m not so worried about that (Shout out [IP Dance Skool](http://www.stylehood.com.tw/2012/skool_01.html)!). Graffiti writers around the world are just a different breed of person. Although we're more aggressive in North America, they're different in a lot of similar ways if that makes sense, haha. The graff scene continues to grow and will only get better. Unfortunately though, DJs and rappers out here continue to get better but there's still a real lack of exposure to more music and so the variety is not as wide spanning as one would hope. What's played out here might not be my cup of tea generally, but I understand its place. We just need balance. That's it.\n\n**Something I’ve noticed already is that streetwear has become really popular out here, and that’s something strange to me because of what I’ve seen in the Bay, like in San Jose where there’s a vibrant dance community. It’s like, these people can afford to dress like this without understanding what hip hop is.**\n\n[![](http://hardboiled.berkeley.edu/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/tumblr_mbxcacepFB1qm5r3ro1_r1_1280-1024x681.jpg)](http://hardboiled.berkeley.edu/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/tumblr_mbxcacepFB1qm5r3ro1_r1_1280.jpg)\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_3649\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"584\"][![Attendees of Fall/Winter 2012 FAME (Fashion Art Music Exposition) in San Jose, California.

He got the cocked back cap, G’d up, and I hit him up to go to a hip hop show, and he told me, “I don’t really listen to hip hop.” And that was it. Mos Def [_btw now Yasiin Bey_] did something, talking about being in a country that is so driven by aesthetics, and how that's so incredible because Japan does so much to make things look pretty, the look is important. In Taiwan it's that as well to a different extent, I wouldn’t say to a lesser extent, not lesser because you still have some very important artists coming out of Taiwan like Hou Hsiao Hsien or James Jean. He did [the wallpaper and fabric prints for] the Prada line in 2008, not sure if he's American-born or from Taiwan, but the aesthetic game for a portion of the population is very high. As a basis though, the problem you encounter in societies like this if everything is superficially based, or more aesthetically based, that's where you stop searching. Some of the music lacks soul. The music sounds right, aesthetically, but it just doesn’t feel right. It didn't quite gel with me when I noticed it.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_3651\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"680\"][![Attendees at the March 2014 event with Raekwon and Ghostface Killah.

What struck me the most was seeing a Taiwanese face not only rapping, but also rapping in a way that stood out from the hypermasculine Asian American hip hop artists I had seen. At the time, I had no idea that I would end up <a href=\"http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m6566sApze1rqmmq4o4_500.jpg\">meeting both Phil Yu</a> the Angry Asian Man and LEO37 in the next three years. PERKS OF BEING ASIAN AND A WRITER WOOT.</span>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>So you’ve been in Taiwan for eight years?</strong> [edit: Shia has been in the hip hop game for eight years. Sam needs to do better research.]</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">No no, three years. I did a tour around Asia with my good friends MAGNOLIUS (Toronto-based Hip-Hop group), back in ‘06, and that was the first time I’d been back as an adult: last time I was back I was 11. I was able to experience a lot, since a lot had changed. Back home, for independent Asian rappers, we were doing okay, had day jobs, but you start to see a roof. When I began to see some of my more favored counterparts and colleagues get deals, some major label, but see them struggle, I thought I’d give it a shot out here. I started going back and forth for several years, and three years ago finally made the move [to Taipei].</p>\r\n<strong>What's a regular day for LEO37 look like?</strong>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As an independent artist, there's nothing regular. Nowadays, independent artists, they have hands in everything. They have to multi-task and be a lot more business minded. Pseudo-entrepreneurs if you will. My day-to-day, it depends. I do a lot of graphic design work, promotion: me and my two brothers (Howie and Tim) run PPF in Toronto and I have the Blast (Serpico, Poppa Baer and Oohchild) out here in Taipei. So it’s different depending on the day. Obviously I'd like to be writing a lot more considering that’s my technical job description and I have three different projects in three different countries that need finishing, but unfortunately, I can’t be in the studio every day.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What's your approach to writing like?</strong></p>\r\n<object width=\"560\" height=\"315\" classid=\"clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000\" codebase=\"http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0\"><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\" /><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\" /><param name=\"src\" value=\"//www.youtube.com/v/2EnCEyZaSZM?hl=en_US&amp;version=3&amp;rel=0\" /><param name=\"allowfullscreen\" value=\"true\" /><embed width=\"560\" height=\"315\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/v/2EnCEyZaSZM?hl=en_US&amp;version=3&amp;rel=0\" allowFullScreen=\"true\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" /></object>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">My brother Howie, he did the videos for \"FANFARE,\" \"YOU &amp; THE NITE,\" produced for my first two albums, did all the artwork for all my physical and digital releases, and he's a songwriter as well.

We did Nike summer nights, their first big streetball tournament in Taiwan, they had us take care of all the programming outside of the basketball.  It was amazing: five weeks, every week packed.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_3643\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"584\"]<a href=\"http://hardboiled.berkeley.edu/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Nike-Summer-Nights-2012.jpg\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-3643\" alt=\"Nike Summer Nights @ Ximending Movie Park, July to August 2012  PC: The BLAST website\" src=\"http://hardboiled.berkeley.edu/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Nike-Summer-Nights-2012-1024x693.jpg\" width=\"584\" height=\"395\" /></a> Nike Summer Nights @ Ximending Movie Park, July to August 2012<br />PC: The BLAST website[/caption]\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Can you talk more about <em>Do You Want More</em>?</strong></p>\r\n<object width=\"560\" height=\"315\" classid=\"clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000\" codebase=\"http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0\"><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\" /><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\" /><param name=\"src\" value=\"//www.youtube.com/v/59adCeahs6I?hl=en_US&amp;version=3&amp;rel=0\" /><param name=\"allowfullscreen\" value=\"true\" /><embed width=\"560\" height=\"315\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/v/59adCeahs6I?hl=en_US&amp;version=3&amp;rel=0\" allowFullScreen=\"true\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" /></object>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>Do You Want More?</em> had a live band and guests, and it was hugely successful for everyone who went. We started to do them monthly, add more guests, do more covers, live remixes, classic hip hop, funk R&amp;B, the momentum kept going. It was the most successful live music event in Taiwan. We felt we kind of plateaued, so we changed it down to a quarterly event in order to make each one a little more special. DYWM became a cultural hub where you saw different cliques and scenes coming together to enjoy good live music. It’s really a special event.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It’s crazy because when we brought Icy Ice of the Beat Junkies [<em>DJ crew formed in 1992 in Orange County</em>], he told us, <em>Yo it's crazy cuz the vibe you guys have here is what it felt like for us 15-20 years ago</em>. But here, the skill level isn't there yet, and it's absolutely not at the fault of the Taiwanese artists. It's still a new culture, they haven't heard enough. The new kids now who are coming into an environment where they've been listening to hip hop, they're catching it faster than the older guys who are trying to maintain, it’s exciting.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What would you describe your style of music as?</strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It’s not hip hop, but it is hip hop. Because of the internet these days, regional hip-hop is less and less evident. So it just depends what you’re around and what inspires you. You got people like ASAP Rocky who sound like Houston but are from New York. I mean, ASAP Rocky grew up in New York, but the Houston sound, that’s what New York radio was playing. It was organic. For me, depending on the producers I’m working with, wherever I am in the world, or what stage in my life I’m at, that will influence what sound I create.  But I still like to think my work, no matter how far it gets, is still Hip-Hop.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As the only Chinese kid in class, I didn’t have rapper or DJ friends, I was an anomaly in my grade. But you know, while all the kids were listening to what they were, and I was listening the same things too, there’s something about being a yellow kid in a pretty much white kids school [in that] hip hop just speaks to you. I was experiencing racism on a regular basis, maybe not outright but little slights here and there. I started getting an inkling of it, once I started touring outside Canada, I started to see…but I truly believe there’s no outright racism, it’s ingrained. At the end of the day, I only had three role models in mainstream media growing up that looked like me: Bruce Lee, Jackie Chan, Dragon Ball Z. I was never a huge fan of Jackie just cause he, more often than not always ended up being a clown. And Dragon Ball Z is a cartoon. So you’re telling me that the last real male role model that I related to cuturally was 40 years ago? And I wasn’t really old enough for [Bruce Lee] to be my role model as a kid. It’s a weird scenario when you grow up in a climate where there was no one Asian to look up to. The Asian performers I saw seemed real cheesy to me where I was, and that wasn’t anything I wanted to be. I understand why people wouldn’t identify with Asian rappers. Not saying my lyrics are Asian-driven but there’s a perspective [the audience] doesn’t have and needs to be able to identify with my music. So I don’t blame anyone. But building and growing a career in Canada was tough. There are good Asian rappers really struggling in the States too, so it made sense that I came to Taiwan and test the waters.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What’s a challenge you’ve faced in coming to Taiwan?</strong></p>\r\n<object width=\"560\" height=\"315\" classid=\"clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000\" codebase=\"http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0\"><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\" /><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\" /><param name=\"src\" value=\"//www.youtube.com/v/hEhwH4G_2PI?hl=en_US&amp;version=3&amp;rel=0\" /><param name=\"allowfullscreen\" value=\"true\" /><embed width=\"560\" height=\"315\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/v/hEhwH4G_2PI?hl=en_US&amp;version=3&amp;rel=0\" allowFullScreen=\"true\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" /></object>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Language is still a problem, I don't speak it at a level that I need it to be. When I'm on stage, I wish I had more to say. I'm getting better. My banter is not that good, and I keep the shows tight cuz I don’t say much. Rather than show my weaknesses, I just push my strengths. The fact that I don't rap in Chinese and refuse to (until it’s at the level of my English) restricts my reach, so I promote and tour always with a band, because at least people can understand music and feeling, you [can] get that. For me, being out here, not only in Taiwan but being in Asia, with the exception of Singapore and the Philippines, everywhere else that doesn’t speak English has forced me to step my stage game up. The challenge keeps things interesting.</p>\r\n<strong>Would you say that Taiwan is still in the early stage of its hip hop scene?</strong>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It is an early stage in Taiwan for hip hop: if hip hop started in 1976 or ‘78 in the US, then in Taiwan we’re in the late 80s right now. [Rappers here] are starting to rap more about things they care about, rather than just being cool at the party, so that’s refreshing, but it’s still in its early stages.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_3648\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"500\"]<a href=\"http://www.wnyc.org/story/89709-south-bronx-hip-hop-year-zero/\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-3648 \" alt=\"Hip hop in the Bronx at the Dixie Club PC: Joe Conzo/WNYC\" src=\"http://hardboiled.berkeley.edu/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Hip-hop-in-the-Bronx-at-the-Dixie-Club.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" /></a> Hip hop in the Bronx at the Dixie Club.<br />PC: Joe Conzo/WNYC[/caption]\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Of course, hip hop is more than just rapping. How has the reception been for the other elements like DJing, graffiti, and break-dancing?</strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Dance by nature in Taiwan is rich: other than b-boying, both popping and locking are huge and Taiwan remain international leaders in both. I appreciate what is growing out here, so I’m not so worried about that (Shout out <a href=\"http://www.stylehood.com.tw/2012/skool_01.html\">IP Dance Skool</a>!). Graffiti writers around the world are just a different breed of person. Although we're more aggressive in North America, they're different in a lot of similar ways if that makes sense, haha. The graff scene continues to grow and will only get better. Unfortunately though, DJs and rappers out here continue to get better but there's still a real lack of exposure to more music and so the variety is not as wide spanning as one would hope. What's played out here might not be my cup of tea generally, but I understand its place. We just need balance. That's it.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Something I’ve noticed already is that streetwear has become really popular out here, and that’s something strange to me because of what I’ve seen in the Bay, like in San Jose where there’s a vibrant dance community. It’s like, these people can afford to dress like this without understanding what hip hop is.</strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://hardboiled.berkeley.edu/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/tumblr_mbxcacepFB1qm5r3ro1_r1_1280.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-3650\" alt=\"\" src=\"http://hardboiled.berkeley.edu/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/tumblr_mbxcacepFB1qm5r3ro1_r1_1280-1024x681.jpg\" width=\"584\" height=\"388\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_3649\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"584\"]<a href=\"http://hardboiled.berkeley.edu/archived-issues/year-16/issue-16-1/\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-3649\" alt=\"Attendees of Fall/Winter 2012 FAME (Fashion Art Music Exposition) in San Jose, California.

He got the cocked back cap, G’d up, and I hit him up to go to a hip hop show, and he told me, “I don’t really listen to hip hop.” And that was it. Mos Def [<em>btw now Yasiin Bey</em>] did something, talking about being in a country that is so driven by aesthetics, and how that's so incredible because Japan does so much to make things look pretty, the look is important. In Taiwan it's that as well to a different extent, I wouldn’t say to a lesser extent, not lesser because you still have some very important artists coming out of Taiwan like Hou Hsiao Hsien or James Jean. He did [the wallpaper and fabric prints for] the Prada line in 2008, not sure if he's American-born or from Taiwan, but the aesthetic game for a portion of the population is very high. As a basis though, the problem you encounter in societies like this if everything is superficially based, or more aesthetically based, that's where you stop searching. Some of the music lacks soul. The music sounds right, aesthetically, but it just doesn’t feel right. It didn't quite gel with me when I noticed it.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_3651\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"680\"]<a href=\"http://hardboiled.berkeley.edu/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/ik20140319-_dsc2855-006-the-blast-x-arta-present-raekwon-and-ghostface-killah.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-3651\" alt=\"Attendees at the March 2014 event with Raekwon and Ghostface Killah.

My mom, on top of being the best, was voted by YWCA as Woman of the Year [<em>part of Women of Distinction awards</em>] for all of the work she does in in the Chinese community, the University as well as all the families she’s helped as a part of the Open Door Society.

Hell, my brother Tim is a drummer and Howie's an animator/writer/director. Weird Asian parents to say the least. But they were also the ones who pushed the arts on me and my brothers. They would bring me to a ton of jazz concerts, classical events, hell, my first concert was Sting when I was 8. They pushed me to play instruments, draw, dance, anything to express myself.

Work hard to understand that all Asians and minorities are different in their own respects.  Understand that each minority group is diverse and has its own ethnic or cultural identity.  That each immigrant has a different story.  That we are not a group that you can conveniently lump together under some ambiguous umbrella term and apply some flimsy category or stereotype to.  That Asians such as Cambodian and Vietnamese refugees have suffered in America, despite working hard, struggle to obtain a decent education, and have remained honest individuals – even contributing members to society – despite the fact that they are subjugated to a social, racial hierarchy created by the White Male.   Essentially, work hard to be educated.  If you do this right, maybe you can be honest, and realize that a social hierarchy does exist and that you are perpetuating it by denying its existence.  Maybe you’ll make it in America.  Not as an “obnoxious” person who is (in)famous because they’re obnoxious, but because you’re diligent, well-learned, and honest.

O’Reilly argues that Asian Americans are actually more privileged than whites, and by this example white privilege cannot possibly exist – a phenomenon widely known as the Model Minority Myth. \r\n\r\nOn “The Daily Show”, host Jon Stewart engages O’Reilly into a debate on the existence of white privilege.  O’Reilly defends his beliefs, but it becomes evident that there are significant logical fallacies and arguments based on pure emotion (and possibly pure ignorance).\r\n\r\n<center><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/3-KBFuobhDk\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></center>\r\n\r\nAt the end, Stewart elicits a concession from O’Reilly that privilege does exist, but for all races.  O’Reilly was also kind enough to provide the following advice:  “If you work hard, if you get educated, if you’re an honest person, you can make it in America!”  \r\n\r\nWell, O’Reilly, I would encourage you to take your own advice.  Work hard to understand that all Asians and minorities are different in their own respects.  Understand that each minority group is diverse and has its own ethnic or cultural identity.  That each immigrant has a different story.  That we are not a group that you can conveniently lump together under some ambiguous umbrella term and apply some flimsy category or stereotype to.  That Asians such as Cambodian and Vietnamese refugees have suffered in America, despite working hard, struggle to obtain a decent education, and have remained honest individuals – even contributing members to society – despite the fact that they are subjugated to a social, racial hierarchy created by the White Male.   Essentially, work hard to be educated.  If you do this right, maybe you can be honest, and realize that a social hierarchy does exist and that you are perpetuating it by denying its existence.  Maybe you’ll make it in America.  Not as an “obnoxious” person who is (in)famous because they’re obnoxious, but because you’re diligent, well-learned, and honest.
